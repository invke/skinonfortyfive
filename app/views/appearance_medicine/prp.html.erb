          Platelet activation plays a key role in the process of wound and soft tissue healing. The use of platelet rich
          plasma (PRP) promotes healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joins, can be applied to various
          musculoskeletal problems.

          what are PRP injections ?
        </h4>
        <p class="text--justify-gt-xs">
          It was used as early as the 1990s in maxillo-facial and plastic surgery. PRP injections are prepared from one
          to a few tubes of the patientâ€™s own blood with strict aseptic technique. After being centrifuged, the
          activated platelets are injected into the abnormal tissue, releasing growth factors that recruit and increase
          the proliferation of reparative cells. Ultrasound imaging may or may not be used to guide the injection.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text--justify-gt-xs">
          Several clinical studies have demonstrated that PRP injections have improved
          function and decreased pain to various maladies, including - but not limited to - elbow, wrist, shoulder, hip,
          knee, and ankle tendonosis. Early work is also showing promise for osteoarthritis.

          are there any risks ?
        </h4>
        <p class="text--justify-gt-xs">
          The side effects of PRP injections are very limited as the patient is utilizing their own blood, which they
          should have no reaction to. Some relative rest is needed immediately following the procedure, then usually
          followed by a progressive stretching and strengthening program.
